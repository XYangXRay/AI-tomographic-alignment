# AI Tomographic Alignment Project

This repository contains all of the progress made toward automatic tomographic alignment using a deep convolutional neural network. It includes all attempts at creating an algorithm to determine alignment parameters, including all of the code used for synthesizing and preparing data to be run in the created models.
